			<p>Hi there! I'm Inma. I'm a big fish that walks around with a camera. I'm insanely passionate about communication and everything visual. I &hearts; watching TV shows, movies, videos of puppies and babies, listening to music, walking around museums and eating coconut dreams. I get excited about musicals, summer days, being near water, christmas lights and ugly sweaters.</p>
			<p>I'm kind of an introvert, and because of my personality I barely ask any questions. Also I'm not great with words. But since I was a little kid, I’ve been obsessed with the act of documentation, taking photos of everything. I'm a visual thinker and photography is how I write my stories.</p>
			<p>I'm originally from Alicante, a very sunny beach town in south-east Spain. Although growing in Spain was a great experience, a couple years ago I decided to move to the US. Now I live and work in Washington D.C.</p>
			<p>In the last few months I joined Isabella Fuentes in her fashion blog project <a href="http://www.thechicmelange.com/">The Chic Mélange</a>. And although most of my experience is in fashion and advertising photography I enjoy working every aspect of it. Hope you enjoy my work!</p>
			<p> -Inma.</p>
